1. Solution and Generative Al Exercise

test data social network json

This exercise involves processing and interpreting data from social network. The evaluation is divided into two main phases:

1. Data Extraction: Review our provided dataset and develop Python code to extract relevant attributes from unstructured text using a Large Language Model (LLM). These attributes should be stored in a relational database for subsequent analysis. We are looking for:

A database schema design.

Utilization of LLM to identify key attributes such as "brand name" and "product name."

Insertion of all identified attributes into the database.

2. Data Aggregation and Insight Generation: Create Python code that utilizes SQL queries to extract insights from the data. The extracted insights should be exported into several CSV-formatted text files. For example, the extract insights could be identifying popular products, brands, and mentioned authors.

Report Summary: After analyzing the insights, compile a report in a Markdown file summarizing your findings in 3-5 sentences.
